# Micah Oh
## Introduction
My name is Micah Oh and I'm in tenth grade at Chatsworth Charter High School. I am currently taking AP Computer Science A, among other AP classes. At home, I have a mother, a father, and an older sister. My sister just graduated this past year and she is going into Cal State Fullerton and majoring in Game Art.

## Summer

This summer, I went to Japan and Hong Kong for about 2 weeks. It was really cool seeing how different the culture is halfway across the world, and I was really admired by how clean it is compared to the States. After coming back from Japan, I binge watched a lot of anime series, including *Mashle: Magic and Muscles*, *Demon Slayer*, *Oshi no Ko*, and *Chainsaw Man*. Other than that, I didn't really do anything else except sleep.

## Personal Achievements
At school, I'm part of the band. Last year, we took the LAUSD championship title for the 1A division. This year, we hope to qualify for SCSBOA (Southern California School Band and Orchestra Association) finals. I also recently hit top 150 in *Splatoon 3* in Americas and Europe over the summer, and I'm hoping to hit top 100 soon.

## Summer Playlist

Over the summer, I became interested in J-Pop because of one of my other friends, and now I can't stop listening to it. My favorite J-Pop/J-Rock artists include Ado, ZUTOMAYO, and Creepy Nuts. Part of my listening to J-Pop so much also comes from visiting Japan for the first time. To me, J-Pop has the talent and creativity when it comes to composing and performing complex songs. For example, ZUTOMAYO has some of the hardest and unique bass lines I've ever heard.
